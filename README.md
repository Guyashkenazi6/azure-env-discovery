# Azure Environment Discovery

## üéØ Purpose
This script collects **high-level information** about your Azure environment to provide a clear overview before diving into technical details.  
It helps identify:

- **Tenant information** (tenant name and ID)  
- **Subscriptions** (list of all subscriptions and their state)  
- **Owners** (who has Owner rights on each subscription)  
- **Plan / Offer type** (Pay-As-You-Go, Enterprise Agreement (EA), Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA), Sponsored/Concierge, Dev/Test, etc.)  
- **Billing agreement type** (EA / MCA / PAYG, if available)

This ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù allows us to quickly understand **who owns what** and **what type of environment you are running**.

## üõ†Ô∏è What does the script do?
When you run the script, it will:

1. Connect to your Azure environment using **Azure Cloud Shell (Bash)**.  
2. Retrieve a list of tenants and subscriptions.  
3. Collect subscription policies such as OfferType, QuotaId, and SpendingLimit.  
4. Identify all **Owner role assignments** (including inherited permissions).  
5. Generate two output files with the collected data:  
   - **CSV file** ‚Üí easy to open in Excel.  
   - **JSON file** ‚Üí structured format for automation or advanced analysis.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

To ensure full results, please verify you have the following permissions:

- **Reader** role on all subscriptions you want to map.  
- **Billing Reader** role on the billing account (to detect EA / MCA / PAYG).  
- Access to **Role Assignments** at the Management Group or Root level (to capture inherited Owner roles).

üìå Notes

	‚Ä¢	If some fields appear as MISSING, it usually means your account does not have the required permissions (e.g., Billing Reader).
	‚Ä¢	The script will not fail if information is missing ‚Äì it will simply mark missing fields instead.
	‚Ä¢	The script only reads metadata; it does not modify or delete anything in your environment.

‚ö° Quick Start (for advanced users)

If you are already in the correct tenant and Cloud Shell (Bash), just run:
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Guyashkenazi6/azure-env-discovery/refs/heads/main/azure-env-discovery.sh)"
```
That‚Äôs it ‚Äî you‚Äôll get both CSV and JSON outputs ready to download.
